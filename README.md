# Task-Manager
We created a tool that where tasks can be logged and tracked for completion for developers to use. Our team tackled this project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# How To Use
Completing the form will add a task in a card to the page with all field inputs and an accurate date. Task progress can be updated as well as deleted when needed using the buttons on the task cards.

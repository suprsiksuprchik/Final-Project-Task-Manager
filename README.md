# Task-Manager
We created a tool that where tasks can be logged and tracked for completion for developers to use. Our team tackled this project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# How To Use
Completing the form will add a task in a card to the page with all field inputs and an accurate date. Task progress can be updated as well as deleted when needed using the buttons on the task cards.

<p>One of the debugging issues was with attatching the gradient on top of the image and we found a simple solution through research.
The group worked well together. The communication between team members through this process was on point and fluid. We all got more familiar with working in a team and all other aspects of coding. We are pleased our project came out the way we had proposed. Though it would seem not many people had branches pushed into main we all worked on it together and mostly pushed from @suprsiksuprchik as she was author of replit, however we all worked together on the project. Replit we found WAS great for peer to peer coding during facetime Zoom calls.
